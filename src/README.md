<p><font size ="20" color="FFBBBB"><b>How the Code Works </b></font></p>
<u>Paragraph 1</u><br>
<p>The program uses the writer method in order to modify text files. It uses writer.write()<br>
in order to modify a file. The CreateFilesBasedOnText file uses a for statement to write<br>
each account line. <br>
</p>
<u>Paragraph 2</u><br>
<p>The program uses the reader method in order to read text files. It uses reader.readLine()<br>
to read a file. The ReadStateFile reads users and sets a string to their values for each <br>
account that it finds.<br>
</p>
<br>
<p>Try catch statements are important in making sure that the code doesn't stop because of exception,<br>
with try being the code that is ran and catch being the element that finds exceptions in the code.

#3. In MediaFile, there is Book, Movie, Song, MySong, and MediaLib.<br/>
#29. I believe a for loop would be better because it has a set number of iterations.<br/>
First loop : <br/>

Second loop : <br/>

**Conclusion Questions :**<br/>
#1. A for loop would be good at finding certain values in a list, while a while loop would be better
 for terminating given a user input.<br/>
#2. The release of devices with larger screen sizes prompted the creation of the Android Honeycomb.<br/>
